Comments

  Code written after a // (for a single line) or between /* and */ are treated as a comment, and will not be executed
Case Sensitive
  camelCasing requires that it does not start with an uppercase letter and lastName is different from lastname
  VAR or Var does not get interptreted as the keyword var
Character Set
  JavaScript uses the Unicode character set
  Unicode covers (almost) all the characters, punctuations and symbols
  http://www.w3schools.com/charsets/ref_html_utf8.asp
  The first 128 characters of Unicode (which correspond one-to-one with ASCII) are encoded using a single octet with the same binary value as ASCII, making valid ASCII text valid UTF-8-encoded Unicode as well.
