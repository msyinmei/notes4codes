##Introduction##

###Node.js###

[Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for building fast, scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O (input/output) model great for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.

How to start a Node.js app via the command line:

```bash
~ $ mkdir AppName
~ $ touch app.js
~ $ touch .gitignore
~ $ git init
```
