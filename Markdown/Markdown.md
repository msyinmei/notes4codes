Markdown
========
Markdown is a plain text formatting syntax designed to convert into HTML and many other formats, using a free software tool written in Perl called "Markdown" that converts the plain text formatting written in the Markdown syntax into HTML.

This document is a simple cheatsheet for my own reference created using the Markdown syntax.

SYNTAX EXAMPLES:
================
setext-style headers for `<h1>` and `<h2>` are created by underlining with (any number of) equal signs (`=`) and hyphens (`-`) respectively by typing it in the following line (row of text).

atx-style headers are created by putting 1-6 hashmarks (`#`) at the beginning of the line (row of text). The number of the hashes equals the resulting HTML header level

Escaping:
P.S. I am able to type the hashtags and code above by escaping individual characters with the backtick '`' signs.


First Level Setext-style Header with equal signs
==========================================

Second Level Setext-style Header with hyphens
-------------------------------------

#First Level Atx-style Header

## Second Level Atx-style Header

### Third Level Atx-style Header

#### Fourth Level Atx-style Header

##### Fifth Level Atx-style Header

###### Sixth Level Atx-style Header

> This is a blockquote. Create a blockquote by using email-style '`>`' angle brackets.
>
> You can create paragraphs in the blockquote. This is the second paragraph.
>
> ## This is a h2 header in the blockquote

This is a regular paragraph, which is basically one or more consecutive lines of text separated by one or more blank lines. A blank line is a horizontal line of input that contains nothing but spaces or tabs. Normal paragraphs should not be indented with any spaces or tabs.


Phrase Emphasis:
----------------
Use asterisks (`*`)
The last word is *emphasized*.
The last words _are also emphasized_.

creates: `<em></em>`


The last words are **strongly emphasized
with two asterisks**.
The last words are __strongly emphasized with two underscores__.
creates: `<strong> </strong>`
